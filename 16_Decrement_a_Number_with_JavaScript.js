/*
I learned:
Just like previous one it is for the decrementing value, I mean we can decrement the value of variable by using minus sign.

For Example:
i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Task:
Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
*/

let myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
