/*
I learned:
We can increment the value that have been assigned to the variable by using just 'VariableName++'.

For Example:
i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Task:
Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.
*/

let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
