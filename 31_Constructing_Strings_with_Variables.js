/*
I learned:
We can also concatenate a more than one variable onto a single string.

For Example:
const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

Task:
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is and and I am well!

// Only change code below this line
const myName = "Zeshan";
const myStr = "My name is " + myName + "and I am well!";
