/*
I learned:
we can joint two string variables by using '+=' literals.

For Example:
const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.


Task:
Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.

// Change code below this line
const someAdjective = "amazing and fun!";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
