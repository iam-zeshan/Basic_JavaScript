/*
I learned:
By using 'Bracket Notation', we can find the Nth character in a string.

For Example:
const firstName = "Zeshan";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string e.

Task:
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.
*/

// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line
