/*
I learned:
'Boolean' data type, it has two types of states 'true and false', true like switch ON and 'false' is like OFF.

Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

Task:
Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.

function welcomeToBooleans() {
    // Only change code below this line
    return true; // Change this line
  
    // Only change code above this line
