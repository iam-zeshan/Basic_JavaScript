/*
I learned:
We can find out the length of the string literals by using JavaScript built in functions.

For Example:
console.log("Zeshan Haider".length);
The value 13 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Zeshan" and "Haider" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "hello", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

Task:
Use the .length property to set lastNameLength to the number of characters in lastName.

// Setup
let lastNameLength = 0;
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
lastNameLength = lastName.length;
