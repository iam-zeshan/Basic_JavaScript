/*
I learned:
When we want to display 'Literal Quotes in the String' then we'll be using this kinda syntax:
const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";

The output would be:
Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

Task:
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
*/

const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"." // Change this line
