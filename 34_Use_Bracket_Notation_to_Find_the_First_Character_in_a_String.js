/*
I learned:
The 'Bracket Notation', by using this we can get any letter from string, I mean in any location by just using the index number in the square brackets.
Unlike human counting but, JavaScript counting is starting from the index '0'.

For Example:
const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

Task:
Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
