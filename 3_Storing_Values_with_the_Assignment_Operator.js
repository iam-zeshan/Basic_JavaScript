/*
I learned:
How we can store value in a variable.

For Example:
var myVar;
myVar = 5;

First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.


Task:
Assign the value 7 to variable a.
// Setup
var a;
a=7;

// Only change code below this line
