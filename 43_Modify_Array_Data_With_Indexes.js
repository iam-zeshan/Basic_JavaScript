/*
I learned:
We can change any data in Arrays at any point unlike String, because it is 'mutable' and we can alter any data at any index freely.

For Example:
const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;
ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Task:
Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
*/

// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// Only change code below this line
myArray[0] = 45;
