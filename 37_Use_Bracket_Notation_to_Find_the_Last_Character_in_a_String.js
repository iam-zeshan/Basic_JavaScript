/*
I learned:
The 'Bracket Notation', we can findout the last character by using bracket notation.

For Example:
const firstName = "Zeshan";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string n.

Task:
Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1]; // Change this line
