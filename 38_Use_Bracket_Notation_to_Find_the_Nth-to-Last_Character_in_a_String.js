/*
I learned:
Again with the use of 'Bracket Notation', we can find from Nth-to-Last character in a string.

For Example:
const firstName = "Zeshan";
const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.


Task:
Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.
*/

// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2]; // Change this line
