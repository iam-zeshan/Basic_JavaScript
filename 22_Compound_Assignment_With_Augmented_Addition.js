/*
I learned:
Instead of adding value i.e 
let myVariable;
myVariable = myVariable + 10;

we can use augmented addition. i.e 
let myVariable;
myVariable += 10;

Task:
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.
*/

let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
