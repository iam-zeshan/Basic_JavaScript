/*
I learned:
The basics of Objects, objects are very similar to arrays. But in arrays we access data using array index number, but here in objects, we use 'properties' to access the data inside of it.

For Example:
const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};

-> we can define an array as the value of the properties of an objects.

Task:
Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties name (a string), legs, tails and friends.

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as name is a string, legs and tails are numbers, and friends is an array.

const myDog = {
    // Only change code below this line
    "name": "Nick Name",
    "legs": 2,
    "tails": 2,
    "friends": [2, 2]
  
    // Only change code above this line
  };
