/*
I learned:
We concatenate String with Plus Operator.

For Example:
'My name is Zeshan,' + ' I concatenate.'

Another Example:
const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.


Task:
Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.
*/

const myStr = "This is the start." + " This is the end."; // Change this line
