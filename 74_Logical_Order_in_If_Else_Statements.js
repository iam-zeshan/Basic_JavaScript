/*
I learned:
Logical order is very important while doing, when you are defining a different logics.

For Example:
function firstFunction(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
And the second just switches the order of the statements:

function secondFunction(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

firstFunction(0)
secondFunction(0)
firstFunction(0) will return the string Less than one, and secondFunction(0) will return the string Less than two.


Task:
Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases.

function orderMyLogic(val) {
    if (val < 5) {
      return "Less than 5";
    } else if (val < 10) {
      return "Less than 10";
    } else {
      return "Greater than or equal to 10";
    }
  }
  
  orderMyLogic(7);
