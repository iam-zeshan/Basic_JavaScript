I learned:
How we can assign one variable value into another one.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

Task:
Assign the contents of a to variable b.

// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b=a;
