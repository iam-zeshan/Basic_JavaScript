/*
I learned:
We can use both 'single quote' and "double quote" as long as these ending with the same quote.

For Example: 
const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';

Task:
Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.

Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.

const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
